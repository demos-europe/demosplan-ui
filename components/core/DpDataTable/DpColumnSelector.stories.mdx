# Column selector

This component can be used as a building block for data tables. It allows for the selection of columns, emits the
currently selected columns, and it is able to store previous user selections in local storage.

## Default usage

```
<dp-column-selector
  :selectable-columns="[[value, label]]"
  :initial-selection="[String]"
  :use-local-storage="Boolean"
  :local-storage-key="String"
  @selection-changed="changeSelection" />
```
