# Accordion

The accordion component can toggle itself via the `toggle` method, but can also be toggled from outside
(e.g. via a save or abort button) by passing the parent's open state as prop (`isOpen`) and calling
a toggle method on the parent `@item:toggle` which toggles the parent's `isOpen` data property.

## Default usage

<Canvas of={DpAccordionStories.Default} />
