# Accordion

The accordion component can toggle itself via the `toggle` method, but can also be toggled from outside
(e.g. via a save or abort button) by passing the parent's open state as prop (`isOpen`) and calling
a toggle method on the parent `@item:toggle` which toggles the parent's `isOpen` data property.

export const Template = (args, { argTypes }) => ({
    props: Object.keys(argTypes),
    components: { DpAccordion },
    template: `<dp-accordion v-bind="$props" />`
});

## With toggle from outside

```
<dp-accordion
  :is-open="isOpen"
  :title="title"
  @item:toggle="(open) => toggleItem(open)" />
```
