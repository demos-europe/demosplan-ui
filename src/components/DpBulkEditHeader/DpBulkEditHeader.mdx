# BulkEditHeader

The BulkEditHeader component allows users to perform bulk editing operations on a set of records.
It is typically used in conjunction with `DpDataTable` or a similar component that allows users
to select multiple records. Then, actions to be performed on that selection can be placed
inside the default slot of `DpBulkEditHeader`.

The component features a visually prominent style and showcases the number of selected items,
along with a button to reset the current selection.

## Custom usage

<Canvas of={DpBulkEditHeaderStories.Default} />
