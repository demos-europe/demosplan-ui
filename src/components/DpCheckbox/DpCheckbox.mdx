# Checkbox

The `DpCheckbox` component renders an input of type `checkbox`. Use it for a single option that the user
can turn on or off.

In order to display several checkboxes grouped together, use `DpCheckboxGroup`.
It allows for defining an additional group label and have checkbox labels with normal `font-weight`.

## When to use

Checkboxes are used when a user can select multiple options. It is possible to select zero,
some, or all options.

## Default

<Canvas of={DpCheckboxStories.Default} />

## Disabled

<Canvas of={DpCheckboxStories.Disabled} />

## Checked

<Canvas of={DpCheckboxStories.Checked} />

## Required

If a checkbox is `required`, an asterisk will be added to its label.

<Canvas of={DpCheckboxStories.Required} />

## Hint

<Canvas of={DpCheckboxStories.Hint} />

## Tooltip

The `tooltip` property adds a contextual help icon that reveals additional information on the input field when the user
hovers over it with their mouse. It should be used sparingly and only to reveal non-critical information, whereas
critical information should be presented immediately.
