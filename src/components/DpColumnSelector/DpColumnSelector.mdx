This component can be used as a building block for data tables. It allows for the selection of columns, emits the
currently selected columns, and it is able to store previous user selections in local storage.

## Default usage

<Canvas of={DpColumnSelectorStories.Default} />

## With initial selection

<Canvas of={DpColumnSelectorStories.WithInitialSelection} />

## With local storage

<Canvas of={DpColumnSelectorStories.WithLocalStorage} />
