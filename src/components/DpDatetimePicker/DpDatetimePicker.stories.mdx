# DatetimePicker

The DatetimePicker component allows users to enter a date and time either by typing or by selecting it from the calendar.

The DateTimePicker control makes it easy to work with dates and times because it handles
a lot of the data validation automatically.

## Default usage

```html
<dp-datetime-picker
  id="dateTimePicker_id"
  v-model="planDateTime" />
```
