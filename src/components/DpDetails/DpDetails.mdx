# Details

The `DpDetails` component is used to reveal detailed information only when users need it.
Other than the accordion or expandable table, it is not used to display tabular data or
multiple items of the same type and structure - it rather represents a single chunk of
information that is shortened to ease scanning of the content it is part of.

## Default usage

<Canvas of={DpDetailsStories.Default} />

## Open by default

<Canvas of={DpDetailsStories.OpenByDefault} />

## With HTML content

<Canvas of={DpDetailsStories.WithHTML} />
