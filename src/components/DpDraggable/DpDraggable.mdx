# Draggable

Use the Draggable component to change the order of items within a list or to move items between lists.

The component provides a wrapper around the [sortable.js](https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable) library (through [@vueuse/integrations/useSortable](https://vueuse.org/integrations/useSortable/)).

## Basic usage

<Canvas of={DpDraggableStories.Default} />

## With custom tag

<Canvas of={DpDraggableStories.WithCustomTag} />

## Dragging between lists

<Canvas of={DpDraggableStories.DragBetweenLists} />

## Disabled dragging

<Canvas of={DpDraggableStories.Disabled} />
