# Editor

The Editor component renders a rich text editor consisting of a menu bar supporting common editor interactions and a text field.

## Default usage

<Canvas of={DpEditorStories.Default} />

## Custom usage

Uploading images can be enabled via the imageButton prop. When using `imageButton`,
the `routes.getFileByHash` prop must be set to an existing route which returns a file by its hash (see second example).

The slot `button` can be used to add additional buttons to the toolbar.

The slot `modal` can be used to add a modal component to DpEditor. The function `handleInsertText`
is exposed to the `modal` slot to enable the modal component to add text to the editor instance.
