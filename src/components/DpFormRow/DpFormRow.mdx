# FormRow

The FormRow component is used to insert form fields into the row.
And through `elementCount` counts the number of elements in the form row.

The Component breaks when trying to render it using Vue3, because it uses `this.$children` which is deprecated
in Vue3. However, **I think we should abandon `DpFormRow` entirely** and use flex utilities instead. For this
to work, DpInput, DpSelect and other form Components should not set their own width but always be sized from outside.

## Default usage

<Canvas of={DpFormRowStories.Default} />
