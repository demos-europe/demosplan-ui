# Input

The `DpInput` component is used for rendering the following form input fields via its `type`prop:
text, email, number, password, and tel.

## Basic text input field

<Canvas of={DpInputStories.Default} />

## Input with label, hint and tooltip

`DpInput` uses `DpLabel` to render a label for the input field.

- The `label` property is used to set the label text.
- `label.hint` adds the provided string between label and input field.
- `label.tooltip` adds a contextual help icon that reveals additional information on the input field
when the user hovers over it with their mouse. It should be used sparingly and only to reveal non-critical information,
whereas critical information should be presented immediately.

<Canvas of={DpInputStories.LabelOptions} />

## Input states: Required, Disabled and Readonly

This example demonstrates different input states:
- **Required**: An asterisk is added to the label
- **Disabled**: The input is grayed out and cannot be edited. It will not be submitted with the form.
- **Readonly**: The input is grayed out and cannot be edited. It will be submitted with the form.

## Input with placeholder

A placeholder provides a hint to the user about what can be entered in the field.

<Canvas of={DpInputStories.WithPlaceholder} />

## Input with length constraints

When `minlength` or `maxlength` are specified, automatic hints are displayed showing the current character count.

## Input with icon

The `hasIcon` prop adds space for an icon element to be positioned inside the input.
