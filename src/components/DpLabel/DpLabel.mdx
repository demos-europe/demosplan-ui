# Label

The `DpLabel` component is used to add a label to form controls.

It is included in the following <strong><i>demosplan-ui</i></strong> form components:

- DpCheckbox
- DpInput
- DpRadio
- DpSelect
- DpDateTimePicker
- DpTextarea
- DpTimePicker

If you want to use any of these components, you don't need to import `DpLabel` separately.

`DpLabel` is currently not included in the following <strong><i>demosplan-ui</i></strong> form components:

- DpMultiselect
- DpTiptap
- DpDatepicker
- DpDateRangePicker

If you want to use any of these components, you need to import `DpLabel` separately.

## Props

- If a form control is `required`, an asterisk will be added to the label.
- The `hint` property adds the provided string below the label.
- The `tooltip` property adds a contextual help icon that reveals additional information on the form control when the user
hovers over it with their mouse.
