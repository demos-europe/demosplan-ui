# Loading

The `DpLoading` component renders a spinning animation alongside some explanatory text.

It indicates background activity and is especially used when components load data on first page load.

<Canvas of={DpLoadingStories.Default} />
<Controls />

## Default usage

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default usage" />
</Canvas>

## Without label

In contexts with limited space, use the `hide-label` prop.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="hideLabel"
    args={{
      hideLabel: true
    }}
  />
</Canvas>

## As overlay

To block interactions with content that is being refreshed, the `overlay` prop may be used.

<Canvas>
  <div style={{ position: 'relative' }}>
    <h3>
      Some content that is still present but covered by the loading component,
      which makes it impossible to interact with said content.
    </h3>
    <Story
      name="Overlay"
      args={{
        overlay: true
      }}
    />
  </div>
</Canvas>
