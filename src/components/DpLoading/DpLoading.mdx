# Loading Indicator

The `DpLoading` component renders a spinning animation alongside explanatory text to indicate background activity.
It's commonly used during data loading, form submissions, or any operation that requires the user to wait.

## Basic Usage

The default loading indicator displays a spinner with the text "Daten werden geladen..." (Data is loading...).

<Canvas of={DpLoadingStories.Default} />

## Without Label

In contexts with limited space, use the `hideLabel` prop to show only the spinner.

<Canvas of={DpLoadingStories.WithoutLabel} />

## As Overlay

To block interactions with content that is being refreshed, use the `overlay` prop. This creates a full overlay that prevents clicks on underlying elements.

<Canvas of={DpLoadingStories.AsOverlay} />

## Best Practices

- Use the loading indicator for operations that take more than a second to complete
- For brief operations (less than a second), consider using a more subtle indicator or none at all
- When using as an overlay, ensure users understand why interaction is blocked
- Consider using the version without a label for small UI elements or repeated loading indicators
