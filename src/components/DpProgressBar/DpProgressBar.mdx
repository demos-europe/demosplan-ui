# ProgressBar

The ProgressBar component displays a colored bar indicating the progress of a specific task or process.
Use this component if you want to communicate to the user:

- The exact progress of a task or process (determinate mode)
- The information that a process is running without specific completion percentage (indeterminate mode)

Do not use it as a loading indicator. To indicate loading state,
use [DpLoading](/docs/components-loading--docs) or [DpSkeletonBox](/docs/components-skeletonbox--docs).

## Determinate ProgressBar

Use the determinate ProgressBar if you know how long a task will take, and you want to inform users about the current
status. The green color indicates (increasing) success.

## Indeterminate ProgressBar

Use the indeterminate ProgressBar if you don't know how long a task will take. It shows a cyclic animation instead of
linear progress.

The blue color indicates that something is happening, but we do not have information on
the progress towards success.
