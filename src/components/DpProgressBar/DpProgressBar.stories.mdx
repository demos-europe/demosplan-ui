# ProgressBar

The ProgressBar component displays a colored bar indicating the progress of a specific task or process.

## Determinate ProgressBar

Use the determinate ProgressBar if you know how long a task will take, and you want to inform users about the current
status.

The green color indicates (increasing) success.

```html
<dp-progress-bar
  label="LabelText"
  percentage="someNumber" />
```

## Indeterminate ProgressBar

Use the indeterminate ProgressBar if you don't know how long a task will take. It shows a cyclic animation instead of
linear progress.

The blue color indicates to the users that something is happening, but we do not have information on
the progress towards success.

```html
<dp-progress-bar
  label="LabelText"
  indeterminate />
```

## When to use
Use this component if you want to communicate to the user

**a)** the progress of a task or process (determinate)

**b)** the information that a process is running (indeterminate).
