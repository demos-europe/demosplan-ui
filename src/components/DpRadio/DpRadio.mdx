# Radio

The Radio component provides a standard radio button input with enhanced styling and accessibility features. Radio buttons allow users to select a single option from a set of mutually exclusive choices.

Use this component when the user needs to select exactly one option from a list of alternatives, such as selecting a single setting from a group of options.

## Default Radio

A basic radio button with label:

<Canvas of={DpRadioStories.Default} />

## Radio States

Radio buttons can be in different states: checked, disabled, and required.

<Canvas of={DpRadioStories.States} />

## Radio with Label Options

DpRadio uses DpLabel, so the DpLabel options can be utilized here as well.
