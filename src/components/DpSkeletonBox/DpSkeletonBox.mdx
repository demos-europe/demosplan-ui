# SkeletonBox

The `DpSkeletonBox` component renders a skeleton loading animation with shimmer effect. It's used to indicate that content is loading, providing visual feedback to users while waiting for data to load.

## Features

- Customizable height and width
- Shimmer animation to indicate loading state
- Simple implementation with minimal overhead
- Flexible sizing to match various UI elements

## Usage Examples

### Default

The default SkeletonBox has a height of '1em' and width of '100%'.

### Custom Size

You can customize the height and width of the skeleton box to match the size of the content it's replacing.

<Canvas of={DpSkeletonBoxStories.CustomSize} />

### Multiple Instances
