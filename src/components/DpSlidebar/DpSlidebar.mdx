# Slidebar

The `DpSlidebar` component creates a sliding side panel that can be opened and closed. It initializes a SideNav instance and provides a consistent interface for slide-in panels throughout the application.

## Features

- Right-side sliding panel
- Built-in close button
- Events for opening and closing
- Slots for custom content

## Usage

The slidebar can be used to display additional information or controls without navigating away from the current view.

### Default

The basic slidebar with default configuration.

<Canvas of={DpSlidebarStories.Default} />

## Implementation Notes

- Closing happens via `data-slidebar-hide` attribute
- Opening happens via emitted event instead of `data-slidebar-show` attribute because sidenav may be initialized before corresponding DOM elements exist
- Content should be placed inside the default slot
