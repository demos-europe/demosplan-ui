# SlidingPagination

The SlidingPagination component is an ARIA-friendly pagination component with a sliding window that adapts to the number of pages. This component ensures that pagination remains usable and accessible even with a large number of pages.

## Features

- Sliding window pagination with adjustable size
- ARIA-compliant for accessibility
- Previous and next page navigation
- Visual indication of current page
- Customizable through props

## Usage

The SlidingPagination component provides intuitive navigation through paged content.

### Default

Default pagination with basic configuration.

<Canvas of={DpSlidingPaginationStories.Default} />

### Large Page Count

When dealing with many pages, the component shows a sliding window.

<Canvas of={DpSlidingPaginationStories.LargePageCount} />

## Implementation Notes

The pagination component does not handle page changes internally. Instead, you need to provide a page change handler that contains your page changing logic (e.g., a Vuex store dispatch) and updates the current page. In future releases, a v-model approach to `currentPage` may be offered.
