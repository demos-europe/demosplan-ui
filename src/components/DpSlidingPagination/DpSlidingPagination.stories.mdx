# SlidingPagination

The SlidingPagination component is ARIA-friendly pagination component with a sliding window.

## Default usage

Basic usage of the pagination component only requires the current page,
the total number of pages and a handler which is called on page change.

The pagination component does not handle page changes by itself, instead you are required to provide a page change
handler which should contain all your page changing logic (e.g. a vuex store dispatch) and eventually change the current
page to the passed one. In later releases, a v-model approach to `currentPage` may be offered, but was opted against
for the time being.

```html
<dp-sliding-pagination
  :current="currentPage"
  :total="totalPages"
  :non-sliding-size="10"
  @page-change="pageChangeHandler" />
```
