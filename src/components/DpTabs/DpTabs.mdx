# Tabs

The DpTabs component provides a structured and interactive way to organize and navigate related content,
allowing users to switch between different views while maintaining context.

## Usage

The Tabs component consists of `DpTabs` as the container and `DpTab` for individual tab panels.

### Default

Basic tabs with two panels.

<Canvas of={DpTabsStories.Default} />

### With URL Fragment

Tabs that update the URL fragment when switching between tabs, allowing for direct linking.

<Canvas of={DpTabsStories.WithUrlFragment} />

### Medium Size

Tabs with medium-sized labels for more compact interfaces.

<Canvas of={DpTabsStories.MediumSize} />

## Implementation Notes

- DpTabs and DpTab both provide a default slot
- For each tab, a `DpTab` instance is placed inside the default slot of `DpTabs`
- The content of each tab is placed inside the default slot of the respective `DpTab` instance
- Tab panels are automatically associated with their tab headers for accessibility
- When using URL fragments, browser navigation (back/forward) will switch tabs accordingly
