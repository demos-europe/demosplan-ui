## Form Validation

The TextArea component integrates with the form validation system through several props:

The `dataDpValidateErrorFieldname` prop allows customizing how the field is referenced in validation error messages.

## Height Control

The component offers different ways to control the height:

- `reducedHeight`: Uses a predefined smaller height (60px)
- `growToParent`: Makes the textarea grow to fill its parent container height
- `attributes`: Allows setting specific dimensions with `rows`
