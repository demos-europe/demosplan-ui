# DpTransitionExpand

A transition component that smoothly animates element height during expand and collapse operations.

## Usage

The DpTransitionExpand component is designed to be used as a wrapper around content that needs to be expanded or collapsed with animation. It's commonly used with `v-show` or `v-if` directives to toggle content visibility.

## Example

A simple example showing the transition effect when toggling visibility.
