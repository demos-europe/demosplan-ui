# DpUploadFiles

The UploadFiles component enables users to upload files by dropping them onto a designated area
or by triggering the process through a button activation.

This component...
* contains the Uppy drop zone
* displays the uploaded files in a list
* handles adding and removing fileHashes to a hidden input (for form posts)

## When to use

If you are implementing a file upload in demosplan, use **DpUploadFiles**.

## Examples

### Basic Upload

Basic single file upload configuration with PDF files only.

<Canvas of={DpUploadFilesStories.Basic} />

### Multiple File Upload

Upload multiple files with different configurations.

<Canvas of={DpUploadFilesStories.MultipleFiles} />

## Custom usage

```html
<dp-upload-files
    allowed-file-types="all"
    :basic-auth="dplan.settings.basicAuth"
    :get-file-by-hash="hash => RoutingFunction('core_file', { hash: hash })"
    :tus-endpoint="dplan.paths.tusEndpoint" />
