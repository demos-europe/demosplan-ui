# Accordion

The accordion component can toggle itself via the toggle method, but can also be toggled from outside
(e.g. via a save or abort button) by passing the parent's open state as prop (isOpen) and calling
a toggle method on the parent @item:toggle which toggles the parent's isOpen data property.

## With toggle from outside

```
<dp-accordion
  :is-open="isOpen"
  :title="title"
  @item:toggle="(open) => toggleItem(open)" />
```
