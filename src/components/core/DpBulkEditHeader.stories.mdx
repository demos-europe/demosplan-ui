# BulkEditHeader

The BulkEditHeader component allows users to perform bulk editing operations on a set of data or records.

In a data management system, users often need to edit multiple records simultaneously.
Instead of editing each record individually, a bulk edit functionality allows users to select multiple records
and apply changes to specific fields in one go.

## Custom usage

```html
<dp-upload-files
    allowed-file-types="all"
    :basic-auth="dplan.settings.basicAuth"
    :get-file-by-hash="hash => RoutingFunction('core_file', { hash: hash })"
    :tus-endpoint="dplan.paths.tusEndpoint" />
```
