# Editor

A rich text editor component based on tiptap.

- defines a menubar with a number of buttons and an editor
- use this component without the inline-editing-wrapper TiptapEditText.vue if you want to add a text editor to a form element (as in new statement view)
- use this component with the inline-editing-wrapper TiptapEditText.vue if you want to save the text directly via inline-editing (as in assessment table)
- the editor-content component needs a prop with editor instance to work correctly

To properly set the content we have to update this.currentValue and use editor.setContent() - both actions are needed!

To use boilerplates we need to mount tiptap editor, where boilerplate modal is imported dynamically.

The boilerplates are stored in boilerplates vuex store, which is also registered dynamically if boilerplate prop is specified.
