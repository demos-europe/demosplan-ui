# Editor

A rich text editor component based on tiptap.

- defines a menubar with a number of buttons and an editor
- use this component without the inline-editing-wrapper TiptapEditText.vue if you want to add a text editor to a form element (as in new statement view)
- use this component with the inline-editing-wrapper TiptapEditText.vue if you want to save the text directly via inline-editing (as in assessment table)

To properly set the content we have to update this.currentValue and use editor.setContent() - both actions are needed!

To use image upload we need to add imageButton Prop.

To use another component within DpEditor, we can add Slot named modal.
