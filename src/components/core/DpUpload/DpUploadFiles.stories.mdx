# UploadFiles

The UploadFiles component enables users to upload files by dropping them onto a designated area or by triggering the process through a button activation.

## Custom usage

```html
<dp-upload-files
    allowed-file-types="all"
    :basic-auth="dplan.settings.basicAuth"
    :get-file-by-hash="hash => RoutingFunction('core_file', { hash: hash })"
    :tus-endpoint="dplan.paths.tusEndpoint" />
```
