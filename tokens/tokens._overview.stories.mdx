# Design tokens

Design tokens are **named entities that store visual design attributes**. While both design tokens and utility classes
are the smallest building blocks of this system, design tokens differ in that they provide a specific usage context
for the values they represent.

Design tokens help **maintaining a scalable and consistent visual system** for ui development. Furthermore, by introducing
specific brand tokens we lay the groundwork for a themeable system.

## Naming scheme

Tokens are made up of the following scheme:

```
<Namespace>-<Category>(-<Domain>)?-<Concept/Element>-<Variant/State>(-<Context>)?
```

- *Namespace* is always "dp"
- *Category* can be "color", "space", or "font-size"
- *Domain* can be "brand", "data", "ui" or "palette" (domain part is omitted for the sake of readability within generated variables)
- *Concept/Element* can be either a color name (in palette colors), or a concept the token applies to (like "main" in brand tokens,
  or "interactive" in ui tokens).
- *Variant/State* can either be a shade ("dark-2" oder "base") in palette colors, or a state (like "hover", or "progress")
- *Context* may further specify in which context a value is intended to be used - `$dp-color-message-severe-interactive`
  should be applied to interactive elements inside messaging components that convey severe state, while
  `$dp-color-status-progress-fill` can be applied to shapes (like icons or rectangles) to communicate that something is in progress.
