# Box Shadow tokens

The demosplan-ui BoxShadow tokens variables adds shadow effects around an element's frame.

There are several sizes (from 1 - smallest elevation, to 4 - biggest elevation). Detailed use cases can be found in the token description.

```
$dp-box-shadow-xl
$dp-box-shadow-lg
$dp-box-shadow-md
$dp-box-shadow
```

The `$dp-box-shadow-1` to `$dp-box-shadow-4` still work, but will be removed eventually.

## How to use and override BoxShadow tokens

BoxShadow tokens can be consumed as Scss variables. To use them, they have to be imported at first:

```
@import '@demos-europe/demosplan-ui/tokens/scss/boxShadow';
```

Then, tokens can be used within Scss code:

```
&.is-active:active {
    box-shadow: $dp-box-shadow;
    color: $actionbox-color-dark;
}
```


### Tailwind utilities

As Tailwind is configured with these variables, too, they can be used as tailwind utility classes.
They replace the BoxShadow classes mentioned within the Tailwind documentation.

```
<div class="shadow">
  Nicely rounded corners.
</div
```
