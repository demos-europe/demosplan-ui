# Breakpoints

The following breakpoints are available:

<Table
  headers={['Scss Variable', 'Tailwind Class', 'Value']}
  rows={[
    ["$dp-breakpoints-sm", "sm:", "620px"],
    ["$dp-breakpoints-md", "md:", "904px"],
    ["$dp-breakpoints-lg", "lg:", "1200px"],
    ["$dp-breakpoints-xl", "xl:", "1400px"]
  ]}
/>

## Usage example - Scss

Breakpoint tokens can be consumed as Scss variables. To use them, they have to be imported at first:

```
@import '@demos-europe/demosplan-ui/tokens/scss/breakpoints';
```

Then, tokens can be used within Scss code:

```
@media all and (min-width: $dp-breakpoints-lg) {
  .some-selector {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

## Usage example - Tailwind utility class

As Tailwind is configured with these breakpoints, too, they can be used as modifiers for tailwind utility classes.

```
<div class="hidden lg:block xl:hidden">
  This only shows up on devices larger than 1200px but smaller than 1400px.
</div
```
