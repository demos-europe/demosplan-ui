# Breakpoints

The following breakpoints are available:

| SCSS Variable           | Tailwind Class  | Value  |
|-------------------------|-----------------|--------|
| `$dp-breakpoints-sm`    | `sm:`           | 620px  |
| `$dp-breakpoints-md`    | `md:`           | 904px  |
| `$dp-breakpoints-lg`    | `lg:`           | 1200px |
| `$dp-breakpoints-xl`    | `xl:`           | 1400px |

## Usage example - Scss

Breakpoint tokens can be consumed as Scss variables. To use them, they have to be imported at first:

```
@import '@demos-europe/demosplan-ui/tokens/scss/breakpoints';
```

Then, tokens can be used within Scss code:

```
@media all and (min-width: $dp-breakpoints-lg) {
  .some-selector {
    display: block;
  }
}
```

## Usage example - Tailwind utility class

As Tailwind is configured with these breakpoints, too, they can be used as modifiers for tailwind utility classes.

```
<div class="hidden lg:block xl:hidden">
  This only shows up on devices larger than 1200px but smaller than 1400px.
</div
```
