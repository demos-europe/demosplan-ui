# Rounded tokens

These tokens define the way things may be rounded in demosplan.

| SCSS Variable         | Tailwind Class   | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `$dp-rounded-full`    | `rounded-full`   | Full - use to craft pill-like elements.                                                                                                                                |
| `$dp-rounded-lg`      | `rounded-lg`     | Large - The biggest radius. Use for boxes that purposefully should appear rounded - plays nice with rounded elements inside it that are rounded via `rounded.DEFAULT`. |
| `$dp-rounded-md`      | `rounded-md`     | Medium - The "next best" radius. Use for larger organisms like list items or areas, that should appear softened but not aggressively rounded.                          |
| `$dp-rounded-default` | `rounded`        | Default - The standard for UI elements that shall appear rounded. Use this value for form elements and other smaller UI elements. When in doubt, pick this one.        |
| `$dp-rounded-sm`      | `rounded-sm`     | Smallest available radius discernible from 0. Use this value for rounded elements inside elements that have `rounded.DEFAULT` applied as border-radius.                |
| `$dp-rounded-none`    | `rounded-none`   | No border radius.                                                                                                                                                      |

## Usage example - Scss

Rounded tokens can be consumed as Scss variables. To use them, they have to be imported at first:

```
@import '@demos-europe/demosplan-ui/tokens/scss/rounded';
```

Then, tokens can be used within Scss code:

```
.toolbar {
    border-radius: $dp-rounded-md;
}

.button {
    border-radius: $dp-rounded;
}
```

## Usage example - Tailwind utility class

As Tailwind is configured with these variables, too, they can be used as tailwind utility classes.

```
<div class="rounded-sm">
  I'm just a little label in a big world.
</div
```
