# Rounded tokens

These tokens define the way things may be rounded in demosplan.

<Table
  headers={['Scss Variable', 'Tailwind Class', 'Description']}
  rows={[
    ["$dp-rounded-full", "rounded-full", "Full - use to craft pill-like elements."],
    ["$dp-rounded-lg", "rounded-lg", "Large - The biggest radius. Use for boxes that purposefully should appear rounded - plays nice with rounded elements inside it that are rounded via `rounded.DEFAULT`."],
    ["$dp-rounded-md", "rounded-md", "Medium - The 'next best' radius. Use for larger organisms like list items or areas, that should appear softened but not aggressively rounded."],
    ["$dp-rounded-default", "rounded", "Default - The standard for UI elements that shall appear rounded. Use this value for form elements and other smaller UI elements. When in doubt, pick this one."],
    ["$dp-rounded-sm", "rounded-sm", "Smallest available radius discernible from 0. Use this value for rounded elements inside elements that have `rounded.DEFAULT` applied as border-radius."],
    ["$dp-rounded-none", "rounded-none", "No border radius."]
  ]}
/>

## Usage example - Scss

Rounded tokens can be consumed as Scss variables. To use them, they have to be imported at first:

```scss
@import '@demos-europe/demosplan-ui/tokens/scss/rounded';
```

Then, tokens can be used within Scss code:

```scss
.toolbar {
    border-radius: $dp-rounded-md;
}

.button {
    border-radius: $dp-rounded;
}
```

## Usage example - Tailwind utility class

As Tailwind is configured with these variables, too, they can be used as tailwind utility classes.

```html
<div class="rounded-sm">
  I'm just a little label in a big world.
</div>
```
