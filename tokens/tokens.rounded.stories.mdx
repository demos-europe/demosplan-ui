# Rounded tokens

The demosplan-ui Rounded tokens is the way things may be rounded in demosplan. Applied via the `border-radius` property.

There are different Rounded variables, you can use any of them for the element.

#### None - No radius.
```
$dp-rounded-none
```

#### Smallest
available radius discernible from 0. Use this value for rounded elements inside elements that have {rounded.small} applied as border-radius.
```
$dp-rounded-smallest
```

#### Small
The standard for ui elements that shall appear rounded. Use this value for form elements and other smaller ui elements. When in doubt, pick this one.
```
$dp-rounded-small
```

#### Medium
The "next best" radius. Use for larger organisms like list items or areas, that should appear softened but not aggressively rounded.
```
$dp-rounded-medium
```

#### Large
The biggest radius. Use for boxes that purposefully should appear rounded - plays nice with, rounded elements inside it that are rounded via {rounded.small}.
```
$dp-rounded-large
```

## How to use and override Rounded tokens

Rounded tokens can be consumed as Scss variables. To use them, they have to be imported at first:

```
@import '@demos-europe/demosplan-ui/tokens/scss/rounded';
```

Then, tokens can be used within Scss code:

```
.segment-list-toolbar--dark & {
    background: $dp-color-white;
    border-radius: $dp-rounded-medium;
}
```

```
&.is-selected {
    background-color: $dp-color-highlight;
    border-radius: $dp-rounded-small;
    font-weight: $bold-font-weight;
    font-family: $bold-font-family;
}
```
